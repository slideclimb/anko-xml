# Anko vs. XML
A collection of Android layouts in both XML and Anko. 
As there is very little Anko documentation, I have found it is often easiest to search for a solution in XML and translate that to Anko... 
Collecting things here to be able to find them back later and skip the XML step.

The layouts currenctly in the repo:

+ `TableLayout`
